# Project Structure
Although this project is a simple demo project but in large projects it plays an important role from the maintability, accessibility, and reusability standpoint. Therfore I have created a different file for each thing so that it can be reusable. Like i created a Pages folder inside java that mantain all the webelement locators. Feature folder contain all the features file, TestRunner folder contain a class which run all the feature files inside Features folder & StepDefs folder contain all the Step defination files which is linked with feature file. You can navigate inside folders to learn more about project structure.

# Execute Tests
